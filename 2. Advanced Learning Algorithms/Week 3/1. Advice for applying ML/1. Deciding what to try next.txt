Sometimes, you implement a ML algorithm lets say a regularized LR algo for performing regression on house prices, but it makes unacceptably large errors. What do try next?

1. Get more training examples
2. Try smaller sets of features
3. Try getting additional features
4. Try adding polynomial features
5. Try decreasing lamda
6. Try increasing lamda

Some of these actions can be fruitful, some of these wont be. Finding a way to make good choices about where to invest your time is the key to being effective at how build a ML algorithm.

This week will cover a set of diagnostics that you can run to gain insight into what is and isnt working with a learning algorithm, to gain guidance into improving it's performance. Diagnostics can take time to implement but doing so can be a very good of your time.
