This is what developing a ML model will look like:

1. Choose architecture of the model (decide on the type of model, what data to use, maybe picking hyperparameters etc)

2. Train the model.

3. Diagnostics (bias, variance and error analysis)

4. Go back to altering the architecture (adding/subtracting features, changing regularization parameter, add more data, make the NN bigger etc) using the insights gotten from the diagnostics.
