Pros and Cons of DT and Tree Ensembles:
* Works well on tabular (structured) data.
* Not receommended for unstructured data (text, audio, images)
* Fast to train. This allows you to loop through the ML Development cycle and improve your model more effeiciently.
* Small decision trees may be humain interpretable. If you are training a small DT, than it may be wise to print it out and see if it works well or if there are some issues with it.
* Tree Ensembles can be computationally expensive.

Pros and Cons of NN:
* Works well on both tabular (structured) and unstructured data.
* May be slower than a DT.
* Works with transfer learning.
* When building a system of multiple models working together, it might be easier to string together multiple NNs.
