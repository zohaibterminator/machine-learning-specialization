Lets go through the process of building a DT for the same cat classification problem.

You have 10 examples at root node. The first step would be, to calculate the I.G for each feature to select the feature to split on. It turns out, that the Ear shape feature has the highest I.G,so we select that. The examples where the ear shape was pointy wemt to the left side, and the rest of examples went to the right. Now, we check for the stopping criteria on either side. The stopping criteria is, when all the examples belong to the same class, stop splitting and make an inference. Since that wasn't the case, as the examples contain mixture of dogs and cats on either side. Next, we focus on the left side. We will compute the I.G for the rest of the two features, face shape and whiskers. We found that the face shape had the highes information gain. The examples which had a round face shape went to the left, which were 4, and the examples who didnot have the round face, went to the right, which was only 1. Again, we check for the stopping criteria. Now we saw that all the examples on the left and right side belonged to 1 class, the left one belonged to cats class, and the right one belonged to dogs class. So, we created two leaf nodes representing that. Now we go back to the right side, and see which feature gives the highest I.G. Whiskers gave us the highest I.G, so we choose that. The examples were split, in which 1 example having the whiskers went to the left, and 4 examples who didnt have the whiskers went to the right. Again, we checked for the stopping criteria, and we found out that for either side, all examples belonged to only 1 class. The left one belonged to the cat class and the right one belonged to the dog class. So we stopped splitting and made a leaf node for inference on each side.
