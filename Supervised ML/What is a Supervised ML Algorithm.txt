Takes X input and gives a corresponding Y output. Learns from being given "right answers".
Examples can be email filtering (giving an email as input and output whether the email
is spam or not)

Types of Supervised ML models are:

1. Regression Algorithms is used for prediction. Give an input X, and the algorithm will
predict or "guess" the output Y. Used to predict output from an infinite possibilities.
For example, house price prediction.

2. Classification Algorithms classifies output Y into a category with respect to the given
input X. Used to predict small number of possible outputs. For example, email filtering.
