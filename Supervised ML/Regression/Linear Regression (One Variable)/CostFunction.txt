f_wb = wx + b

w and b are the parameters of the model. Also called weights and coefficients

ŷ_i = f_wb(x_i)
f_wb(x_i) = w*x_i + b

How to find values of w and b so the prediction y hat i is close to the true target y^i for many or maybe all training examples x^i, y^i?

We measure how well the line fits the data. For that, we use a cost function

The cost function is denoted by J(w,b)

J(w, b) = 1/2*m * Sum(ŷ_i - y_i)^2

We can also subsitute the value of ŷ_i from above

J(w, b) = 1/2*m * Sum(f_wb(x_i) - y_i)^2

Also called squared error cost function.
