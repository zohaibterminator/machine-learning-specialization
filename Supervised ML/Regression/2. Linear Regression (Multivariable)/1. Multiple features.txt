In multiple linear regression, we predict y_i with multiple features.

New notations are:

1. n is the number of features.

2. x_j is the j-th feature.

3. X⁽ᶦ⁾ (X superscript i) denotes the list (or sometimes called row vector) that includes all the features of the ith training example

4. X_j⁽ᶦ⁾ (X subscript j and superscript i) denotes the j-th feature of the i-th training example.
