Lets understand KMeans with an example. Lets say you plot 30 data points on a graph, and ask KMeans to group the data into 2 clusters (you can decide how many clusters you want the algorithm to group the data into). The first thing KMeans would do is, to take 2 guesses of where the centers of the 2 clusters would lie. These centers are called "cluster centroids". Next, the algorithm will go through each point in the dataset, and find the distance between the point and each cluster centroids. The point will be assigned to the closest cluster centroid. After performing that step for each point, it will take all the points belonging to a cluster centroid, and take an average of them, and then move that cluster centroid to the location found after taking the average of the points. We do the same for the other cluster centroid. Now, with the new cluster centroids, we will perform the whole thing again. If you keep repeating these steps, you will see that after a certain point, the assignment of the points wont change.
