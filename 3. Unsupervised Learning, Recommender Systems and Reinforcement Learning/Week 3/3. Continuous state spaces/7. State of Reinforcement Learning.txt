Lots of hype around RL is because many research publications have been on simulated enviroments, but it is much easier to get to work in simulation than a real robot. A lot of developers have commented that, it is suprisingly challenging to get something to work in a real world or the real robot. Secondly, there are a far fewer applications of RL than supervised and unsupervised learning. The odds of finding a supervised or unsupervised learning method to be more suited to a problem is higher. But, there is a lot of exciting research in RL that can open doors for potential applications in the future.
