Data comes with inputs x but no output labels Y. The goal is to find patterns, structures
or something interesting in unlabeled data.

Types of Unsupervised ML algorithm are:

1. Clustering groups similar data into clusters.For example, Google news. Given a news,
suggest related news.

2. Anomaly Detection is used to detect unusual data points. For example, in the financial
system, it is used to detect whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

3. Diminsionality Reduction is used to compress large data sets into smaller ones while
losing as little data as possible.
