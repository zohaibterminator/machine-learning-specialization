The techniques are:

1. Divide by Maximum value:
Let's suppose x_1 ranges from 300 to 2000, we divide each value in x_1 by 2000, that is the maximum value of range. You can do the same to x_2.

2. Mean Normalization:
You scale the features to be centered around 0. Before they had values greater than zero, but now they can have negative and positive values, usually around -1 and 1. To mean normalize the feature, you must first calculate the mean of the feature you want to scale. Then minus that average from each value of the feature and divide it by difference between maximum and minimum value of that feature. The formula is:
    x = (x - mean)/(max_val - min_val)
Where x is the feature.

In case of x_1, if the mean of x_1 is 600, then the formula will become:

    x_1 = (x_1 - 600)/(2000 - 300)

The new range of x_1 will become -0.18 to 0.82.

3. Z-score Normalization:
First you need to calculate the mean and standard deviation of the feature, and then subtract the mean from each value of the feature while dividing by the standard deviation. The formula will become:

    x = (x - mean)/std_dev

The rule of thumb for feature scaling is to scale the range of the features to be around -1 to 1. But it can be a loose. if the ranges lie between -3 to 3 or -0.3 to 0.3, that is still completely okay. If the range is 0 to 3, you can rescale if you want, but it is okay if you don't. Some examples where you should rescale are:

-100 to 100     Too large
-0.001 to 0.001 Too small
98.6 to 105     Values scale around 100, which is too large
