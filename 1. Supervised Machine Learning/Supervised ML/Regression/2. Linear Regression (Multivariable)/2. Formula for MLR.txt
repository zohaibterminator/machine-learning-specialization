previously: f_wb(x) = wx + b

now: f_wb(x) = w_1.x_1 + w_2.x_2 + w_3.x_3 + w_4.x_4 + b

for the house prediction model, the equation will become,

f_wb(x) = (0.1).x_1 + (4).x_2 + (10).x_3 + (-2).x_4 + 80

where,
x1 = size
x2 = number of bedrooms
x3 = number of floors
x4 = number of years (age of the house)
80 = base price

Let's think a bit about how you might interpret these parameters. If the model is trying to predict the price of the house in thousands of dollars, you can think of this b equals 80 as saying that the base price of a house starts off at maybe $80,000, assuming it has no size, no bedrooms, no floor and no age. You can think of this 0.1 as saying that maybe for every additional square foot, the price will increase by 0.1 $1,000 or by $100, because we're saying that for each square foot, the price increases by 0.1, times $1,000, which is $100. Maybe for each additional bathroom, the price increases by $4,000 and for each additional floor the price may increase by $10,000 and for each additional year of the house's age, the price may decrease by $2,000, because the parameter is negative 2.


Looking at the above example, the general formula for MLR for n number of features will become:

f_wb(x) = w_1.x_1 + w_2.x_2 + ... + w_n.x_n + b

since x and w are row vectors, we can also say that MVL is the result of dot products of w and x vectors and adding b.

f_wb(x) = w.x + b

we can also write a little arrow on top of w and x to signify that they are row vectors.

Also, dont confuse it with "Multivariant LR".
