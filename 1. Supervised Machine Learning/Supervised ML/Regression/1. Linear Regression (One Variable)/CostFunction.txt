f_wb = wx + b

w and b are the parameters of the model. They are adjusted during training to improve the model. They are also called weights or coefficients.

ŷ_i = f_wb(x_i)
f_wb(x_i) = w*x_i + b

How to find values of w and b so the prediction y hat i is close to the true target y^i for many or maybe all training examples x^i, y^i?

We measure how well the line fits the data. For that, we use a cost function.

The cost function is denoted by J(w,b)

J(w, b) = 1/2*m * Sum(ŷ_i - y_i)^2

We can also subsitute the value of ŷ_i from above

J(w, b) = 1/2*m * Sum(f_wb(x_i) - y_i)^2

Also called average squared error cost function. Division by 2 is not necessary, it just "makes some of our later calculations look neater", whatever that means.

You can use different cost function for different applications. This one is the most common one.
