When you feed a model a training dataset, it outputs a function or a hypothesis. We denote it with the letter f

The function now gets a completely new input x and outputs an estimate or prediction ŷ (pronounced y-hat). ŷ is an estimate of the true value
of x, y. y is also called "target" or output variable.

In Linear Regression, f can be represented as:

f(x) = wx + b

This is called Linear Regression with one variable or Univariate Linear Regression
