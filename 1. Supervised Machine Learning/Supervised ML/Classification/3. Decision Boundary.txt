We know that we in order to make a logistic regression model able to predict binary classes we need to make a certain threshold on the basis of which we will make the prediction. If we choose the threshold of 0.5, so if f_wb(x) is greater than or equal to 0.5, then predict y is one and if f_wb(x) is less than 0.5, then predict y is 0. But what if f_wb(x) is exactly 0?

  z = w.x + b = 0

This line is called decision boundary. Now, how do we find the decision boundary? We just use the above equation. For example, if we have a training set of 2 features x_1 and x_2, and if the values of parameters w_1, w_2 and b are 1, 1, and 3 respectively, then the decision boundary will become:

  x_1 + x_2 - 3 = 0
  x_1 +_ x_2 = 3

Even if we have a polynomial model we can use the same equation:

  x_1^2 + x_2^2 = 3 (if the values of parameters w_1, w_2 and b are 1, 1, and 3)
